Contributing
------------

Please make PRs to the `beta` branch so we can test stuff in beta first :smile:.

In terms of actual code, you'll find most things you need in app/. The serve.sh script will let you test things.

Please discuss any changes with us in #ten.java since we're usually planning new functionality and contests. We want to ensure any
work fits in with our plan of future events.

Environment
-----------

You must define an environment config if you wish to run this application locally!
Store this as `.env` in the root and fill in the details.
