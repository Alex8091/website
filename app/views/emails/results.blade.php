Hi there {{ $user }}!

According to our records, at some point in the past you've expressed interest in the ten.java contest. Whether or not
you were actually able to participate on July 12th, we thought you might be interested to see the results.

We'll be announcing the winners this Saturday at 7PM UTC (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1409425200+unix+time).
We'll most likely have some games (e.g. Cards Against Humanity, TF2) if you want to join us a bit earlier/afterwards in IRC.

As always, we'll announce things on the website and via Twitter.

Hope to see you there!

Regards,
The ten.java Team
