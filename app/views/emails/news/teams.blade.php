    <h1>Hey, {{{ $name }}}!</h1>
    <p>
        It's official. The next ten.java is on its way, and it comes bearing some big news.
    </p>
    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
        New to ten.java? That's okay! ten.java is a biannual competition in which participants create plugins for
        Minecraft based off of a theme. The first two competitions have been ten, consecutive hours long. This is an
        announcement for the next, upcoming competition.
    </p>
    <h2>When?</h2>
    <p>
        Hopefully sometime this winter. We are currently planning for December. The when all depends on what happens
        when the dust settles around Minecraft.
    </p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>
        In teams! It's been suggested a ton, and we think that it's a great idea. The next ten.java will be a team-based
        competition, in which a group of people work together to create an awesome mod/plugin based on a theme.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current plan is to have teams be created on the website (tenjava.com) by a team leader. Then, members can be
        invited by the leader to join the team. Teams will have a maximum of five members and a minimum of three members
        (leader included in both counts). We will also have a method for participants to meet other participants without
        a team in order to form a new team, so no one is left out. Remember: none of this can be done yet. This is just
        an announcement of our plans.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's all that there is to officially announce currently. There are definitely more things in planning! When
        there is more that is officially decided upon, another topic will be made.
    </p>
    <p>
        Definitely looking forward to the next one. It's gonna be great.
