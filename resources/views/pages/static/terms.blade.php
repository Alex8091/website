            obligation) to, in ten.java's sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in ten.java's
            reasonable opinion, violates any ten.java policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii)

            believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as
            necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other
            harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise
            objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other
            errors. The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes
            the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use
            of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. ten.java disclaims any
            responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Website, or from any downloading by

        <h2>5. Content posted on other websites</h2>
        <p>
            We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available
            through the websites and webpages to which tenjava.com links, and that link to tenjava.com. ten.java does
            not have any control over those non-tenjava.com websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their
            contents or their use. By linking to a non-tenjava.com website or webpage, ten.java does not represent or
            imply that it endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to
            protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or
            destructive content. ten.java disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of
            non-tenjava.com websites and webpages.

        <h2>6. Copyright infringement and DMCA policy</h2>
        <p>
            As ten.java asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property
            rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by tenjava.com violates your
            copyright, and if this website resides in the USA, you are encouraged to notify ten.java in accordance with
            ten.java's Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") Policy. ten.java will respond to all such notices,
            including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the
            infringing material. ten.java will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Website if, under
            appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other
            intellectual property rights of ten.java or others. In the case of such termination, ten.java will have no
            obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to ten.java.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
            This Agreement does not transfer from ten.java to you any ten.java or third party intellectual property, and

            ten.java. ten.java, tenjava.com, the tenjava.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and

        </p>
        <p>
            You agree that any amount paid into the prize pool will be distributed according to section 16.2. You agree
            that any such payments are non-refundable, and, in the case that any portion of the prize cannot be
            distributed, you will not receive a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            You agree that any payment to ten.java and its organizers is non-refundable.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Teams</h2>
        <p>
            By joining a team, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms:
        </p>

        <h3>16.1. Prize fees</h3>
        <p>
            Any money collected incurs a handling fee after $1,000 USD has been handled by ten.java's account. Any money
            donated to either a) the prize pool or b) the organizers will contribute to this limit. After $1,000 USD has
            been handled, a 2.9% + 30¢ fee will be applied after the funds are received by ten.java. This will not cost
            any donor any additional fees. The total on the <a href="/prize">prize page</a> will be updated in order to
            show these applied fees, but the displayed amount may not be exact.
        </p>

        <h3>16.2. Prize distribution</h3>
        <p>
            Upon completion of judging of all submitted entries, the total prize pool will be distributed based upon the
            set rules of the winning team. All members of the team are required to agree to the rules before the contest
            officially starts, and the rules may not be changed after the start of the contest.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are several methods for distribution, any one of which may be chosen by a prize recipient. Available
            methods are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A mailed check/cheque (if outside of US, check your bank's ability to cash US checks/cheques)
                <ul>
                    <li>Necessary postage costs will be debited from the portion of the prize won.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://square.com/cash">Cash</a> (US only)</li>
            <li>PayPal transfer (extra fees from PayPal apply)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If any prize recipient is unable to receive money via one of these methods, he will not receive his portion
            of the prize, and his portion will be redistributed, according to his team's rules, amongst the other
            members of his team, if possible. If, for any reason, the portion of the prize cannot be redistributed, due
            to rules or otherwise, it will be kept by ten.java.
        </p>

        <h3>16.3. Team rules</h3>
        <p>
            Every member of a team is required to agree to his team's rules. Any breach of these rules may be handled by
            the team leader or a ten.java organizer. The team leader has the right to revoke repository access of any
            member during the contest. The team leader also has the right to reinstate repository access of any member
            during the contest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ten.java organizers reserve the right to remove any member from any team for a) a breach of team rules,
            b) a breach of contest rules, c) a breach of United States law, d) a breach of the law of the country the
            member resides in, if not the United States, or e) legal reasons, including, but not limited to, a court
            order.
        </p>
        <h4>16.3.1. Member removal</h4>
        <p>
            The team leader has the right to remove any member from his team before the team-change deadline, as defined
            by ten.java, for any reason. If a member breaks the team rules during the contest, the team leader may
            revoke his repository access. After the contest has ended, the team leader may contact the ten.java
            organizers and have the offending member removed from the team, thereby removing the offending member's
            share in the prize, if his team wins. The team leader must present the organizers with evidence of the
            rule-breaking in order for the member to be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a member wishes to leave his team, he may do so via his team page before the team-change deadline. If he
            wishes to leave his team after this deadline, it may only be due to no longer agreeing to these terms, and
            he must contact an organizer to facilitate his removal. If a member leaves his team during the contest for
            such reasons, he may not re-enter or join another team during the length of the contest or after the
            contest; he may only re-enter during the next contest, if any such contest exists.
        </p>

        <h2>17. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between ten.java and you concerning the subject matter
            hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of ten.java,
            or by the posting by ten.java of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
            otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website will be governed by the laws of the state of
            California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising
            out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County,
            California. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property
            rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising
            under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the
            Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with
            such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the
            arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce
            this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid
            or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining
            portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this
            Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any
            subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to,
            and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; ten.java may assign its rights under this Agreement
            without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their
            successors and permitted assigns.
